				<h2>Circle Games</h2>
				<p>Circle games.  Some ways to form Joeys into a circle are <a href="../management.html#circle">explained here</a>.</p>
				
				<h3>Alphabet Game<span>(bean bag)</span></h3>
				<p>Joeys sit in a circle.  A category is selected [animals, food, jobs] and Joeys pass the ball to each other.  Starting at ‘A’, Joeys must name something in the category starting with the letter, eg apple, banana, carrot, donut, etc.  If a Joey can’t think of anything they have to stand up.  Last one sitting wins.</p>
				
				<h3>Ball Clap<span>(soft ball)</span></h3>
				<p>Joeys form a circle around the leader.  The leader throws a ball to a Joey and they must clap before they catch it.  If they drop it or don’t clap the Joey sits down.  Last one wins.  If it’s too easy make them clap twice before catching.</p>	
				
				<h3>Bang, Bang</h3>
				<p>Joeys form a circle with one Joey in the middle.  The middle Joey aims their finger gun at a circle Joey and says “Bang!”  The shot Joey squats down, the two Joeys on each side of the shot Joey try to shoot each other first with a “Bang!”  The loser of the shoot-out then squats down.  Last one wins.</p>
				
				<h3>Dog and Possum<span>(2 different colour bean bags)</span></h3>
				<p>The Joeys form a circle. The Leader takes one bean bag (the possum) which they start on its way round the circle. A moment later they start the other bean bag (the dog). The dog must catch the possum.</p>

				<h3>Let’s go to the zoo</h3>
				<p>This game is a variant of ‘Fruit Salad’.  Joeys form a circle.  Each Joey is given the name of an animal.  For more than about 6 Joeys you can double up on the names [eg kangaroo, snake, eagle, elephant, tiger, crocodile].  When their animal is called the Joey/s run  around the circle and back to their place, making appropriate sounds and actions, e.g. kangaroos hop, eagles flap their wings, tigers growl, etc.  When “Let’s go to the zoo” is called everyone runs around the circle and back to their place.</p>
				
				<h3>Oshikura Manju</h3>

				<p>Japanese kids play this game to get warm in Winter.  Joeys form a circle with their backs to the centre.  They have to walk backwards until the circle is very small and their backs are touching.  Then Joeys cross their arms over their chests and on “Go!” they push with their backs.  They continue until they fall down or need to be reset.</p>

				<p>An alternative is to put a rope circle around the Joey circle about a metre wider out.  Then Joeys must push each other out of the circle.</p>

				<p>Another way to play is to make two lines back-to-back.  Joeys now link their arms through the elbows and grab their hands in the middle to lock in.  Then the two teams push.  Again you could have a line to work towards.  This game is rather like a reverse tug-of-war, plus it is safer.</p>
				
				
				<h3>Stick Mimes<span>(broomstick or other stick)</span></h3>
				<p>Joeys form a circle with one Joey in the middle with a stick.  Middle Joey mimes out something with the stick.  Circle Joeys put their hands up to guess, if correct they go to the middle.  Many groups of words can be used such as ‘doing words’, ‘jobs’, ‘sports’, ‘things’, etc.</p>
