				<h2>Joey Management</h2>

				<p>Similar to classroom management for teachers, Joey Leaders need ways to get Joeys to do what we ask.  Joeys don't always do what we ask, sometimes because they've misunderstood and sometimes because we haven't asked them in a fun way.  The following are a few methods to get Joeys to do things quickly, easily and enjoyably.</p>

				<h3>Getting Joeys' Attention</h3>

				<h4>Claps</h4>
				<p>Claps are a good way to get the Joeys' attention.  They don't have to be looking at you to notice and they like to clap and be loud.  The leader claps a short sequence, not too long, about 5 claps, and with a little training the Joeys will drop everything to clap the sequence back to you.  Some example sequences:</p>
				
				<ul>
					<li>clap, clap, pause, clap, clap, pause, clap</li>
					<li>clap, clap, 3 fast claps</li>
					<li>3 fast claps, clap</li>
					<li>clap, pause, clap, clap, clap</li>
				</ul>

				<p>You could also use a whistle if playing a wide game or with a large group</p>

				<h4>Do this</h4>
				<p>The leader loudly says "Joeys" and then Joeys must copy their actions when they say "Do this", "and this", "and this".  Three times is enough to have them focussed.  Some simple action suggestions: </p>

				<ul>
					<li>Stick one leg in the air.</li>
					<li>Stand up straight and tall with your arms straight up.</li>
					<li>Cross your arms.</li>
				</ul>

				<h4>Touch your elbow</h4>
				<p>The leader says "Joeys, touch your elbow, touch your toes, touch your nose" and Joeys must follow along.</p>

				<h4>Eyes</h4>
				<p>Directing the eyes of Joeys can be effective.  The leader can say "Joeys, eyes to the ceiling, eyes to the floor, eyes to me."</p>
				
				<h4>When you're finished</h4>
				<p>At the end of an activity and when you want to start a new one the leader can say "When you're finished put your hands on your heads".  This shows the leader who is finished and who is still going, it becomes a race for the Joeys to finish so they hurry and it keeps their hands busy so they don't touch any equipment you might be laying out.</p>
				
				<h4>Hand in the air</h4>
				<p>The leader holds the Scout sign up in the air to signal for silence. Joeys who see the leader in turn put their Scout signs into the air as they notice and become quiet until everyone is silent.</p>
				
				<h4>Countdown</h4>
				<p>The leader asks the Joeys to do something, such as line up at the door, but the Joeys are a little slow doing it.  So start a loud countdown, "5, 4, 3, 2, 1".  Joeys will naturally react to this artificial urgency.  The last Joey could get a mild forfeit, for example they have to tell a joke or that they are 'in' for the next game.</p>



				<h3>Keeping Focus</h3>
				
				<h4>Where is the focus?</h4>
				<p>Joeys will focus on anyone speaking or anyone doing anything interesting.  This is good in one way and bad in another.  When explaining an activity ideally only one leader should be speaking.  This means other leaders shouldn't be jumping in with disciplinary remarks or added information.  If you think the leader explaining has missed an important point, go up to the leader and tell them quietly and then let them relay the information.  Joeys are confused when three different leaders are telling them various things and standing in three different spots.  Joeys also like to know who is the 'boss' of the activity.</p>

				<p>It follows then that the leader who is explaining should be standing in front of the Joeys and the other leaders should be standing somewhere else.  To the side is usually best because if the leaders all stand at the back then the Joeys often turn to see what they're doing.  Other leaders of course will be helping when the activity starts, but for an explanation it is best for the focus to fall on only one leader.</p>


				<h4>Giving Joeys the focus</h4>
				<p>In many activities a Joey may need to be the focus.  If you are having a discussion and you want one Joey to answer a question or offer some information then you need a way to get just that one to do it and nobody else.  Putting your hand up is the traditional method.  Naming individual Joeys works fairly well as long as you know everyone's name.  Another way is to have a prop such as a soft ball to show whose turn it is to speak.  Throw the ball to one Joey, they answer and then they throw it to someone else to answer.  Unfortunately balls roll away into corners easily so a soft toy such as a stuffed kangaroo can be better.  You could also use a short stick as a kind of 'magic speaking wand' or a 'microphone'.  Putting a hoop over the chosen Joey is also a fun idea.</p>


				<h3>Giving Directions</h3>
				
				<h4>Keep it short</h4>
				<p>If Joeys seem restless and inattentive often it is our fault.  One of the biggest factors is how long we talk about what we're going to do.  Joeys don't want to listen to instructions, they want to do an activity.  So the best advice is keep everything non-activity related relatively short.  Parades shouldn't drag on, there shouldn't be extended chats with one particular child while others wait around, directions shouldn't be ten steps long, etc.  If your Joeys have trouble standing still on parade then perhaps it's because they've been standing still for too long.</p>

				<h4>Show, don't tell</h4>
				<p>The best way for Joeys to understand an activity is to be shown.  They will understand better and will remember better.  Scouting is learning by doing.  For craft make sure you have a pre-made example to show them what they're aiming for.  Do the craft one step at a time as they follow along.  When explaining instructions for a game have yourself or another leader demonstrate the actions and go through the motions while you're talking.</p>

				<h4>Keep it simple</h4>
				<p>You will of course still have to give verbal instructions sometimes.  Keep phrases short and use <a href=http://dictionary.cambridge.org/grammar/british-grammar/commands-and-instructions target=new>commands/ imperatives/ present simple</a>.</p>

				<ul>
					<li>"Run to the bowl and take a beanbag."</li>
					<li>"Don't go outside the safety cones."</li>
					<li>"Clap before you catch the ball."</li>
					<li>"You glue the eyes onto the rock."</li>
					<li>"Everyone has to touch the tree."</li>
				</ul>

				<h4>Concept checking questions</h4>
				<p>There is a method in teaching called 'concept checking questions' (or CCQs).  When you ask at the end of a series of instructions "Does everyone understand?" most of the time everyone will say yes but later you'll realise that many did not.  Nobody likes to put their hand up and stand out, no Joey wants the leader to continue talking when a game is about to start and nobody wants to be publically shown to be foolish, ie to not understand something.  So most students, even older and adult ones, will always say they understand whether they do or not.</p>
				
				<p>CCQs are here to save us.  A CCQ is a Yes/No question that properly checks whether a group has understood.  You should use 'correct' questions as well as 'incorrect' questions (which are explained below) and 3 is a good number to ask.</p>

				<p>Okay, let's look at some CCQs for the game Bullrush. Firstly we might explain the game like this: "Joeys line up on this line.  Chloe, you're in, stand here.  When Chloe calls 'bullrush!' everyone has to run to the other side.  You have to stay within the safety cones.  If Chloe touches you, you're now in.  The game ends when everyone is in."</p>

				<p>Now some example CCQs:

				<ul>
					<li>"Joeys, do we run outside the safety cones?" [The answer should be 'No', this is an 'incorrect' type of question.]</li>
					<li>"Do we run when Chloe calls 'bullrush'?" [Yes, 'correct' type.]</li>
					<li>"Do we run to the other line?" [Yes, 'correct' type.]</li>
					<li>"Do we run when Chloe calls 'bullpoo'?" [No, 'incorrect' type and you'll get a laugh.]</li>
					<li>"Do we run all the way to Melbourne?" [No, 'incorrect' type.]</li>
				</ul>

				<p>You will know if not enough Joeys understand the activity from the answers.  You can then explain or demonstrate everything again or just that one point.  As a bonus, when you ask the 'incorrect' type of questions Joeys will usually be thinking about the correct answer, reinforcing the instructions in their mind.</p>

				<h4>Putting it together</h4>

				<p>Here's a bad example of instructions:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Now Joeys, the first thing you have to do is to throw this tennis ball through the hoop that's way down there then run all the way down, around, run quickly back and then give the ball to your partner.  Sorry, I meant when you've run down there get the ball and then run around and back, around the hoop.  Then give the ball to your partner who I hope will be ready to do the same thing as you have, we'll all be ready won't we Joeys?  Great, does everybody understand?  (Joeys: yes) Yes?  Good-o, let's start.</li>
				</ul>

				<p>Here's a good example:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>First, throw the ball through the hoop. (Another leader is doing the actions as they explain)  Run and get the ball.  Run back.  Give the ball to the next Joey.  Okay Joeys, do we throw the ball at Bagheera? (Joeys: no)  Do we throw the ball through the hoop?  (Joeys: yes)  Do we bring the ball back? (Joeys: yes)  Right, are you ready?  Go!!</li>
				</ul>



				<h3>Moving Joeys around</h3>
				
				<h4><a name="sorting"></a>Sorting Joeys into teams</h4>
				<p>Often for games and other activities you need to move the Joeys into teams.  One simple way to make two teams is to get them into a line along the hall and tell each Joey who is at the front to alternately go and stand against the left wall or the right wall.</p>

				<p>Another popular way is to number the Joeys, [eg 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, etc.] then to ask the teams to find each other and line up.  However numbering is boring and the Joeys forget easily so you can instead give them different animals, for example [cat, dog, bird, cat, dog, bird, etc.], for three teams of course.  Then you ask the Joeys to get into their teams and when they're ready to make that animal's sound.</p>

				<p>A slightly harder variation is to give them each a different word, all of which relate to a few others in a certain way.  An example for two teams could be: [carrot, dog, apple, lion, cheese, tiger, sandwich, monkey, etc.] and then you would say "The food team should stand in a line here, the animal team should stand in a line over there".  Even harder would be to make them work out the groups themselves but that is usually beyond the reach of Joey aged children.</p>

				<p>If you want them in pairs you can use pairs of words which are related, for example: [dog, sty, lion, kennel, pig, den, etc.]  Make sure to mix up the order randomly.  Then they would have to find their partner.  For all these kinds of ordering it would be better to have the list written down prior to the activity rather than trying to make it up on the spot.</p>


				<h4>Formations</h4>
				<p>To form Joeys into a line give them a point to start the line and a direction to follow.  Standing at the point with your arm outstretched in the way you want the line to form is usually the most effective method.  However you could also use a Joey or an object as the starting point.  If you want two lines then hold both your arms out in front or name two Joeys to be the starting points. You might say "Line up behind Adam" or "Line up at the door" or "Form two lines in front of me".  In fact it's good to have common command language and formation points that you use every week so that the Joeys get somewhat trained.</p>

				<p>Lining up on parade is also a useful sort of 'line' to sort the Joeys or explain something because if you stand in the middle of the semi-circle then everyone can see you.  When Joeys are in a line and you want to explain something, don't stand at the front of the line as then only one Joey has a good view.  Stand to the side of the line so all the Joeys can see without stepping out of the line.</p>
				
				<p><a name="circle"></a>When forming a circle you can stand in the middle as a starting point.  Outstretch both arms and turn around to show them that you want a circle formed.  Joeys can hold hands to distance themselves more evenly around.  If you want a bigger or smaller circle just tell them to take a step or two inwards or outwards.  Stand in the middle if you want to explain something, if you stand outside the circle it will soon be deformed as the Joeys turn to look at you.</p>



				<h3>Discipline</h3>

				<h4>Sitting out</h4>
				<p>I think we can agree that shouting at Joeys is not a very good form of discipline.  Sitting out of an activity is a much better method.  However we don't want disciplinary measures such as sitting out to be punitive, instead we want to make the Joey feel like they should to do the right thing the next time.  So when we sit a Joey out it shouldn't be for a whole activity.  We want to put the Joey somewhere they can see the activity being run so that they feel like they want to participate and therefore to behave.  If you send the Joey outside they will miss out completely and probably just get angry.  If they watch the activity they will be focussed away from anger but instead into a desire to join in.  And we want them to join in.  Joeys come to have fun, they should only be sat out if they are overly disruptive to the fun of others.</p>

				<h4>Clean slate</h4>
				<p>Joeys are young children and almost all of them will grow out of any bad behaviours they might have now.  All we can do is help to show them how to act around others.  This means we should think of them as good kids that sometimes behave badly, rather than thinking of them as bad kids.  One way to do this is to give them a clean slate each week and perhaps even each activity.  We shouldn't try to tally up their past wrongs from previous meetings and treat them extra badly because of it.  If a child has to somehow overcome and make up for all their previous wrongdoings then they will never succeed.  All we want them to do is behave right now.  Behaving right now is all we can ever expect them to do until they get older.  So don't constantly refer to past misdeeds, the Joey will barely remember them let alone why they did them.</p>
