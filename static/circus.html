				<h2>Circus for Joeys</h2>
				<p>Joeys love to try simple circus skills.  They are especially interested in having a go with the special equipment involved.</p>

				<h3>Tumbling and Acrobatics</h3>
				<h4>Forward rolls</h4>
				<p>On grass, or perhaps some puzzle mats if you have them, Joeys could try a forward roll.  Demonstrate how to do it for them:
				<ol>
					<li>Stand up straight with your feet together.</li>
					<li>Bend down and put your hands on the ground in front of you.</li>
					<li>Tuck your head into our chest as you kick your legs over.</li>
				</ol>
				<p>Once they can do it you could get them to try it through a hoop resting on the ground and held upright.</p>

				<h4>Handstands</h4>
				<p>Handstands are fairly safe on grass while leaning against a fence.  Don't force anyone to do it of course.  They can be included in an obstacle course or ask them to hold it for a count of 5.</p>

				<h4>Other ideas</h4>
				<ul>
					<li>wheelbarrow races</li>
					<li>bear walking (walking on hands and feet, face down)</li>
					<li>crab walking (walking on hands and feet, face up)</li>
					<li>pencil rolls (lying down with arms stretched out)</li>
					<li>egg rolls (rolling sideways while curled into a ball)</li>
				</ul>

				<h3>Dressing Up</h3>
				<p>The easiest way to incorporate dressing up is to ask your Joeys to come dressed as circus people, some of which could include:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Ringmaster (top hat, red jacket)</li>
					<li>Clown (extra big clothing, crazy wig, red nose, big glasses, etc.)</li>
					<li>Acrobat (gymnastic leotard, singlet with long black pants)</li>
					<li>Lion or other circus animal</li>
				</ul>

				<p>Other ways include holding dress up relays or bringing some masks or funny hats to add to their uniform.</p>

				<h3>Circus Craft</h3>
				<h4>Balloon Twisting</h4>
				<p>Twisting balloons is an excellent craft for Joeys which is fun, fairly easy to learn and is something they wouldn't usually have a chance to do.</p>

				<p>There are only a few things to remember with balloon twisting:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Stretch the balloon a few times before inflation.  This makes it easier to pump up.</li>
					<li>Leave a bit of unpumped up tail at the end of your balloon to allow expansion of the air.  This makes twisting easier.</li>
					<li>‘Burp’ the balloon after pumping, ie let a bit of the air out.  This makes the knot easier to tie.</li>
				</ul>

				<p>You can buy double action pumps in stores sometimes, but the internet is a sure bet.  Double action means it pumps both on the push and the pull action.  Also, try to buy good quality balloons or they will break really easily.  The standard is Qualatex, they are about $25 dollars for 250.  Again you can buy these on ebay or elsewhere.</p>
				<p>It’s good to get your leaders to help you blow up enough balloons plus some extras before the meeting, it will only take 5-10 minutes to do 20 or so.</p>
				<p>You should try for very easy designs like the sword.  You could do 2 designs in a night easily.  Some suggestions:</p>

				<h5>Sword</h5>

				<p>Make the loop just tight enough for the sword tip to fit.  Joeys can have a safe ‘fight’.  Swords carry into many themes such as pirates, knights, light sabers in space, etc.</p>

				<h5>Sword belt</h5>

				<p>Joeys can wrap them around their waists to size the belts first.</p>

				<h5>Hat</h5>

				<p>You can do something with the dangly bit or fold it over into more of a helmet.</p>

				<h5>Easy dog / basic animal</h5>

				<p>A dog with a long neck is a giraffe.  A dog with a long neck and a long tail is a dinosaur.  A dog with a long body is a ‘sausage dog’.</p>
				
				<h4>Juggling Balls</h4>
				<p>Cut the ends off of two balloons.  Get a plastic lunch bag and put a scoop of rice inside.  Twist or tie the bag up, a small rubber band can also help.  Stuff the bag 
				into the balloon.  Put another ballon around the first.  An alternative is to use two scrunched up plastic shopping bags instead of the rice, although this does make 
				the balls much lighter.</p>

				<h3>Circus Skills</h3>
				<p>Joeys are a bit young to learn to juggle but there are lots of other circus skills which are fun to try.</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Plate spinning is quite simple, at worst you can spin the plate for them and let them hold the stick.  You can buy plate spinning plastic plates with sticks included for relatively cheap.  You could even make the sticks by sharpening some thin wooden dowels.</li>
					<li>Poi are easy to make.  Get a long sock such as a football sock and put a tennis ball inside.  You can look up some simple poi skills on youtube such as the Butterfly or Figure Eights.</li>
					<li>Diablo is quite tricky but let them try to spin it if you have one.</li>
					<li>Devil/ flower sticks are also difficult, you can show Joeys the principle by having them kneel down and letting them try with one end of the stick on the ground.</li>
					<li>Balancing on your hand can be done with a stick, a juggling club, a racquet or similar.  They could also try balancing it on their shoulder, nose, chin, elbow, knee, etc.  The trick is to look at the top of the object.</li>
					<li>Hula hooping can be done not just around the waist but also around a Joey's wrist, neck or leg.</li>
					<li>Stilts are easy to make, you can just use a block of wood with a rope loop to hold, or make the longer 'stick with block attached' type.</li>
					<li>Balance boards/ rola bolas definitely shouldn't be used by Joeys or even adults who think it looks simple.  You can easily break an arm or collar bone falling off of one.  However you can get those circular exercise boards with a hemisphere on the bottom that let you wobble around a bit.  Another type is a kind or circular blow up matt that similarly wobble you safely around.</li>
					<li>Cigar boxes are expensive but you can use any smaller, hand sized box.</li>
					<li>Stick twirling can be done with a stave or broomstick.</li>
