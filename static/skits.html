				<h2>Skits</h2>
				<p>Joey skits need to be simple, short and funny.  Demo the skit with a leader or parent, if you can, before getting the Joeys to practise it.</p>

				<h3>Is It Time?</h3>
				<p>Sitting in a line with legs crossed all to one side, the first Joey asks “Is it time?”, which gets passed down the line.  The last Joey says “No.”, which is passed back down the line.  The first Joey waits a bit and repeats.  Repeat 3-4 times.  On the last time the last Joey says “Yes” and the whole group crossed their legs to the other side.</p>

				<h3>We Have No Skit</h3>
				<p>First scout walks out, stops, slaps his forehead and shouts, 'Oh No!'</p>
				<p>Next Scout runs up to him and asks 'What's Wrong?'</p>
				<p>First Scout whispers in his ear, and Scout #2 says 'Oh No!'</p>
				<p>Repeat this for each scout running to the group until only the last one is left. He runs up and asks 'What's Wrong?'</p>
				<p>All Scouts: We have no skit!!!</p>

				<h3>Firing Squad</h3>
				<p>(3 soldiers in a holding cell stage left. In walks the leader of the enemy.)</p>
				<p>Leader: You have all been found guilty of spying. You will each be shot by firing squad as soon as the squad arrives.</p>
				<p>Leader: First prisoner, take your place! …… Ready! ….. Aim! …….</p>
				<p>Prisoner #1: HURRICANE! </p>
				<p>(all the soldiers scurry for cover looking afraid. The prisoner runs offstage. When they realise there is no hurricane, the soldiers line up again)</p>
				<br/>
				<p>Leader: Next prisoner, take your place! ….. Ready! ….. Aim! …..</p>
				<p>Prisoner #1: TIDAL WAVE!</p>
				<p>(Again they look scared and the prisoner runs off.)</p>
				<br/>
				<p>Leader: Next prisoner, take your place! ….. Ready! ….. Aim!</p>
				<p>Prisoner #1: FIRE!</p>
				<p>(the prisoner falls dead, being shot by the solders)</p>

				<h3>The Ugliest Man in the World</h3>
				<p>Caller: Gather round! Step right up! Who is brave enough to gaze on the face of the ugliest man in the world? Only one dollar! Step right up! Hey, you there - are you brave enough?</p>
				<p>Scout #1: Sure, I'm brave! Here's your dollar, let me see him.</p>
				<p>(Scout #1 walks up to ugly man and peers under the blanket at his face. He then screams, falls back, and faints.)</p>
				<p>Caller: Now that was a brave lad! But, he couldn’t look at the ugliest man in the world. How about you, sir? Are you strong enough and brave enough?</p>
				<p>Scout #2: Ha! You better believe it. Here's two dollars. Now, let me see him.</p>
				<p>(Scout #2 peers under the blanket with similar results.)</p>
				<p>(repeat this for all the scouts until they are all fainted.)</p>
				<p>Caller: Certainly there must be someone here brave and strong enough to view the ugliest man in the world and live to tell about it. Anyone? How about you, sir? (addressing the leader or other unsuspecting adult. Coax him up or work on someone else until someone is convinced to try.)</p>
				<p>When the victim looks under the blanket, the ugliest man in the world screams and runs away in fright.</p>

				<h3>Echo</h3>
				<p>The leader announces that he has noticed an echo and he is going to try it out (also could be on a hike overlooking a canyon). The following is a dialogue between the leader and the echo - a person out of the room or out of sight.</p>
				<p>Leader: Hello</p>
				<p>Echo: Hello</p>
				<p>Leader: Cheese</p>
				<p>Echo: Cheese</p>
				<p>Leader: Rubbish</p>
				<p>Echo: (silence)</p>
				<p>Leader: (to group) Hmmmm… I'll try again. (to echo) RUBBISH!!!</p>
				<p>Echo: (silence)</p>
				<p>Leader: (to group). Let’s try one more thing…. [Leader’s name] is the greatest!</p>
				<p>Echo: Rubbish</p>
				<p>(Note: Be sure to hide your echo team well, so the campers don’t see them!)</p>

				<h3>Oh, that’s just a …</h3>
				<p>(Joeys walk around as if they’re on a hike)</p> 
				<p>A Joey (shouts): “Oh no, what’s that?”</p>
				<p>Leader Joey: “Oh, that’s just a (tree).”</p>
				<p>B Joey (shouts): “Oh no, what’s that?”</p>
				<p>Leader Joey: “Oh, that’s just a (rock).”</p>
				<br/>
				<p>(Etc. for other Joeys in the group.)</p>
				<p>Finally,</p>
				<br/>
				<p>Last Joey (shouts): “Oh no, what’s that?”</p>
				<p>Leader Joey: “Oh, that’s just a monster.”</p>
				<p>(Joeys keep walking a bit ….)</p>
				<p>Leader Joey: “Oh, wait, did I say monster?”</p>
				<p>(All Joeys shout and run away.)</p>

				<h3>Elevator</h3>
				<p>An elevator operator says, “Ground floor” and opens the door. A passenger gets in and begins to jiggle slightly as the elevator rises. The elevator operator announces each floor: “First floor, Women’s clothing.” The door opens and another passenger gets on and begins to jiggle too. Continue up through as many floors as you need to get your whole group onto the elevator. “Second floor, Men’s clothing”… “Sixth floor, Kitchenware”… etc. As the elevator rises higher and higher, the passengers jiggle more and more.</p>

<p>Eventually the elevator stops. The operator calls, “Top floor, last stop...” Everyone starts to jiggle like mad. “…Bathrooms!”  Everyone rushes off the elevator and races off to the bathrooms. Elevator operator shakes head in disbelief. Suddenly, the operator pulls a funny face, begins to jiggle; shouts, “Me, too!” and rushes off after them.</p>
