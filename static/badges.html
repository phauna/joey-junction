				<h3>Joey Participation Scheme</h3>
		
				<p>The Participation Scheme includes five badges. Each of the badges are usually done by the whole Mob together. Some badges have elements that families can do together with their Joey Scout.</p>
				<p>In addition to the specific aspects of each badge, these activities develop the Joey Scouts' social awareness and spirit of teamwork. The participation scheme has an accent on cooperative, active learning.</p>

				<br/>

				<h4>Care and Share Activity</h4>	
				<p>Each Mob plans and runs programs for one month that focus on caring and sharing. Then the Mob does a special deed for the local community.</p>
				<p>Some suggestions for the special deed include:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Take some dogs from an Animal Refuge for a walk.</li>
					<li>Collect cans for a food drive.</li>
					<li>Do Clean Up Australia Day or clean up a local park.</li>
					<li>Visit a hospital or nursing home and sing songs, chat, hand out flowers or books, perhaps something seasonal like candy canes or Easter eggs.</li>
					<li>Plant trees during National Tree Day.  Local councils often provide everything you need, you just have to turn up with your Mob and provide the labour.</li>
				</ul>

				<br/>

				<h4>Buddy Scheme</h4>
				<p>Joey Scout Mobs visit each other, share activities and have great fun. The Mob Buddy Scheme aims at building a rapport and friendship between different Mobs.</p>
				<p>Any activity is acceptable for the visit, although it's usually one Mob going to the hall and participating in the meeting of the second Mob, then vice versa.  You also have the option of using the Internet to interact with the other Mob if it's too far to meet up in person.</p>
				<p>The Mobs then share an outdoor activity such as a sleepover or a Mob Holiday.</p>

				<h4>The Promise Challenge</h4>
				<p>The <a href="https://docs.google.com/viewer?a=v&pid=sites&srcid=ZXBwaW5nc2NvdXRzLmNvbS5hdXxlcHBpbmctc2NvdXRzLWdyb3VwfGd4OjExZWI1MTQwMWE1ZjBmOWQ" target="new">Promise Challenge (pdf)</a> is the major Challenge for the Joey Scout Section and has some individual elements as well as activities to do with the Mob. This is generally attempted by the older Joey Scouts. The aim of this challenge is to allow Joey Scouts to gain a greater understanding of the Scout Promise and Law, to learn about Scouting's Founder, Lord Robert Baden-Powell, and to discover the history of Scouting. The challenge requires the Joey Scout to complete certain elements, such as research and discussion with their parents and Leaders, away from the Mob meetings. The Joey will also be required to give a presentation to the Mob on completion of the task.</p>
